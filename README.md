### What I learned

Interesting mini project. So far I haven't use radio buttons before but I learnt much from this project. Also the 'selected' styling of the button needed JS.

Getting more comfortable with making simple components responsive.

### Continued development

A good test for me using JS. Have learnt how to inject html using JS upon hitting the submit button. Injecting html through JS should be a fundamental skill I need to develop going forward.
